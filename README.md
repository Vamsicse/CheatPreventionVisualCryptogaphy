# CheatPreventionVisualCryptogaphy
Visual Cryptography is a method of encrypting a secret image in to n shares such that stacking a sufficient number of shares reveals the secret image. Unlike conventional cryptographic methods, VC needs no complicated computation for recovering the secret. The act of decryption is to stack shares which is the bitwise OR operation of pixels in the shares. Most of the previous research work on Visual Cryptography focuses on improving two parameters Pixel expansion and contrast. This paper considers the attacks of malicious adversaries who may deviate from thescheme in any way. There are three cheating methods that are applied on existing Visual Cryptography schemes. This paper improves one of the cheat-preventing schemes. A generic method that converts a Visual Cryptography scheme to another Visual Cryptography scheme that has the property of cheating prevention is proposed. The overhead of the conversion is near optimal in both contrast degression and pixel expansion.
